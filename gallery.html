        <p class="resize">My works are just at the intersection of doodle and abstraction. I am interested in creating fictional characters and to narrate their story through the illustration.
            Fantasy is center of my works.  Most of my illustrations are inspired by anime and manga.
            In my painted world I want to intact,overlap,pile-up,and  ultimately create a sense of visual distance and depth
            so that one can connect with the fantasy. I like to add a modern comic touch to garnish my style.
            Please don't report and copy my work.
            Thank you.
